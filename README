WillItWebGL
-----------

WillItWebGL is a simple utility for testing whether your current
configuration should run WebGL. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
It tries to test whether your current configuration *should* support
WebGL, not whether the major browsers will actually work.  It is meant
to help determine whether a user should even bother trying to enable
WebGL. For instance, Intel GMA 950 cards only implement a GL 1.x
version, so they won't run WebGL in any browser.


Technical Details
-----------------

WebGL is based on OpenGL ES 2.0, which is in turn based on (though
differs substantially from) OpenGL 2.0. The most basic test is whether
a recent enough OpenGL is supported: is OpenGL even available, and if
it is, is the version the driver is reporting recent enough?

Other tests that might be added in the future:
 * Heuristics to determine likely performance: renderer string may
   indicate software vs. hardware rendering.
 * Implementation specific tests - implementations may have slightly
   different requirements of the underlying OpenGL implementation. Using
   this information we might be able to suggest which implementations
   will work.
 * Support for ANGLE - testing for a recent DirectX version may also
   be sufficient to run WebGL.


Implementation Details
----------------------

WillItWebGL is essentially an OpenGL application that does nothing but
try to allocate an OpenGL context and check versions/extensions.  The
code is based on visualinfo from GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/),
and licensed under the Modified BSD License.
